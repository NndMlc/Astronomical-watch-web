Astronomical Watch Core License v1.0 (NO MODIFICATION LICENSE)

Copyright (c) 2025 NndMlc
All rights reserved.

1. Definitions.
   "Core" means the set of source files located under the path
   src/astronomical_watch/core/ as listed verbatim in CORE_FILES.md at the time of distribution.

   The protected Core now explicitly includes:
   - __init__.py
   - solar.py
   - equinox.py
   - timeframe.py
   - timebase.py
   - vsop87_earth.py
   - nutation.py
   - frames.py
   - delta_t.py

2. Grant of Permission.
   You are permitted to (a) use and execute the Core; (b) copy and redistribute
   exact, unmodified copies of the Core; (c) create and distribute separate
   software that merely imports or calls the public APIs of the Core ("External Software").

3. No Modification / No Derivative Works.
   You may NOT modify, adapt, translate, reverse engineer (except to the limited
   extent required by applicable law), or create derivative works of the Core.
   Private experimental modifications are allowed solely for internal evaluation
   and MUST NOT be redistributed in any form (except as permitted under Section 11).

4. Patches Upstream.
   If you wish to propose improvements, submit them as patches (e.g., pull requests)
   to the original repository. Acceptance is at the sole discretion of the author.

5. Trademark / Name.
   You may not use the "Astronomical Watch" name, logo, or confusingly similar
   marks to market modified versions or forks. Compliance with this License does
   not grant trademark rights.

6. Combination.
   External Software combined with the unmodified Core remains outside the scope
   of this License, but must not include copies of modified Core code.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty.
   THE CORE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
   INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

8. Limitation of Liability.
   IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER
   LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM,
   OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE CORE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE CORE.

9. Termination.
   Any breach (including unauthorized redistribution of modified Core) terminates
   this License automatically. Upon termination you must cease distribution and
   destroy copies under your control, except for compliance archives.

10. Governing Law.
    This License shall be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction of the Author's
    residence unless otherwise required by applicable law.

11. Security Exception.
    Solely to remediate a documented, exploitable vulnerability (one that enables
    incorrect code execution, denial of service, privilege escalation, or data corruption)
    you may create and temporarily distribute a patched version of the Core provided that:
      (a) The patch is the minimum necessary change.
      (b) You notify the original project (public issue or designated security contact/email)
          within 5 calendar days of first public distribution.
      (c) You clearly and prominently mark the patched version as "UNOFFICIAL SECURITY PATCH"
          including a diff or description of the change.
      (d) You submit the patch upstream and cease distribution within 30 days unless the
          patch (or an equivalent fix) is accepted upstream or the author grants written extension.
    Any other modification or continued distribution outside these bounds remains prohibited.
