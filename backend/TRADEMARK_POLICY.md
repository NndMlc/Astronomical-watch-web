# Astronomical Watch Name Usage Policy (Informal)

"Astronomical Watch" is a project identifier. You may use the name to refer to the unmodified Core implementation. Modified or alternative implementations must:

1. Clearly differentiate their name (e.g., "Astronomical Watch Fork", "Astronomical Watch Derived", or a distinct brand).
2. Not imply official status without explicit written permission.
3. Remove claims of strict compliance if Core algorithms diverge from SPEC.md.

This policy does not grant trademark rights; it is a usage guideline. Formal registration may occur later.
