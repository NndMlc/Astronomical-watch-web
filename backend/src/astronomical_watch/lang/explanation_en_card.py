Astronomical Watch — Explanation

Astronomical Watch is a clock that displays time based on actual astronomical cycles, instead of the conventional calendar time. This watch is designed for anyone who wants to understand and follow time according to the Earth's movement around the Sun, free of conventional constraints like calendars, time zones, and local time.

Why does the year begin at the vernal equinox?
-------------------------------------------------
Unlike the standard calendar which starts the year on January 1st, the astronomical year on this watch begins at the moment when the Sun crosses the celestial equator — the vernal equinox. This moment is a natural zero point for astronomical cycles, marking the start of a new "solar circle" and best reflecting real changes in the length of days and nights. It is the period when day and night are approximately equal, making it a universal starting point for measuring time.

The time interval between two consecutive vernal equinoxes represents the exact duration of one tropical year. A tropical year lasts about 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, and 45 seconds — the time it takes the Earth to return to the same position relative to the Sun, or for the vernal equinox to occur again.

The vernal equinox is extremely important in human history, as many calendars are synchronized with this astronomical event. Egyptian, Persian (Iranian), and ancient Greek calendars, as well as the Hebrew and Chinese lunisolar calendars, traditionally begin the year near the vernal equinox. Persian Nowruz — the new year holiday — is celebrated precisely on the day of the equinox, while in the Roman calendar, March, the first month, is linked to the arrival of spring. In the Orthodox tradition, the date of Easter is determined by the first Sunday after the vernal equinox and the full moon.

A special mention goes to the Milanković calendar, one of the most precise calendars ever proposed. Milutin Milanković, when constructing his calendar, took the vernal equinox as the starting point, ensuring that the year in his system closely follows the duration of the tropical year and the Earth's movement around the Sun. Milanković devised a leap year system that keeps the vernal equinox within the same date, eliminating the long-term drift present in the Julian and even Gregorian calendars.

Why is the day measured from a specific meridian?
-----------------------------------------
The astronomical day on this watch begins at a precisely defined moment of noon at a reference meridian — 168° 58′ 30″ west. This line is the midpoint between Little and Big Diomede islands, which represent the natural boundary between America and Russia, or between the eastern and western hemispheres. This meridian is also known as the International Date Line and is used as the dividing line between the previous and the current day. Most world maps divide the Earth at this point, making it ideal for global synchronization of astronomical time.

Why use mean astronomical noon?
--------------------------------------------------------------
True local solar noon changes each day due to the Earth's orbital speed and axial tilt. Therefore, "mean astronomical noon" is used — a reference, average noon moment for the chosen meridian. This method eliminates daily small variations known as the Equation of Time, which can cause differences of several minutes between true and mean noon. Using mean noon provides stable and predictable timekeeping, independent of local changes.

Equation of Time
--------------------------------------
The Equation of Time is the difference between true solar time (real noon) and mean solar time. This difference arises from the elliptical orbit of the Earth and its axial tilt. Astronomical Watch displays the day relative to mean noon but uses astronomical functions to calculate and show the deviation, allowing users to see how real noon differs from the average. This information is useful for understanding natural time rhythms and the difference between calendar and astronomical days.

What functions does Astronomical Watch use?
------------------------------------------
Astronomical Watch uses several advanced astronomical functions:

- Precise determination of the moment of the vernal equinox for each year using highly accurate astronomical calculations.
- Calculation of days since the equinox, enabling precise tracking of the astronomical day in the year.
- Thousandth part of the day ("miliDies") for very fine division of time within each day.
- Calculation of mean noon at the reference meridian and display of the deviation from true noon ("Equation of Time").
- Dynamic interface color change (gradient) according to the position of the Sun in the sky.
- Countdown to the next vernal equinox, with special fireworks effects at the equinox moment.

Universal time — Astronomical Watch vs. standard clock
----------------------------------------------------------
One of the most important differences is that Astronomical Watch displays the same time for everyone on the planet. Time is globally defined according to astronomical cycles and does not depend on local time zones. No matter where you are — north or south, east or west — the watch shows the identical Dies and miliDies for every user at the same moment. A standard clock, on the other hand, uses local time and time zones, so time differs from place to place, while Astronomical Watch eliminates those differences and creates a unique universal system.

History of standard time
-----------------------------
Standard time and the system of time zones arose only in the late 19th century with the development of railways and telegraphs. Before that, each place had its own local time determined by true noon, so clocks in cities were different. The first official time zone was introduced in Canada in 1878, and the International Meridian Conference in Washington in 1884 adopted the Greenwich meridian as the zero point for timekeeping. Time zones became practical for global communication and transport but introduced arbitrary, political, and social differences in everyday life. Astronomical Watch overcomes those differences, returning time to its natural, universal foundations.

Comparison with standard time
----------------------------------
Standard time is a product of historical, geographical, and social agreements. Time zones are defined by political boundaries, and the start of the day and year is not tied to natural astronomical events. For example, midnight in standard time does not mark any particular astronomical phenomenon but is an arbitrary point on the local clock. Astronomical Watch, on the other hand, ties all its units to real astronomical moments, such as equinoxes and solstices, making every day, hour, and minute part of a universal cycle valid for the entire planet.

Practical use
------------------
Astronomical Watch is useful for scientists, astronomers, educators, nature lovers, and anyone who wants to align with the Earth's universal rhythms. It provides a sense of connection to the planet and cosmic events, enables easier global understanding of time without confusing local differences, and encourages users to think of time as a universal, natural phenomenon.

Why track time astronomically?
---------------------------------
Astronomical Watch allows users to track time in the way closest to actual astronomical cycles and the Earth's movement around the Sun. This approach gives a deeper understanding of natural rhythms, helps in education, encourages connection with nature, and enables global coordination without artificial differences in time.

In short, Astronomical Watch is the clock of the future — universal, precise, educational, and inspiring.
